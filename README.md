The unchecked spread of fake news and misinformation on digital platforms poses a serious risk to society by shaping public perception, fueling unrest, and tarnishing reputations. Traditional fact-checking methods are too slow to effectively manage the high volume of misleading content circulating online. To mitigate this issue, we propose the development of an AI-driven Fake News Detector that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to scrutinize textual data, recognize patterns of false information, and classify content as trustworthy or deceptive. This solution will provide users with instant content verification, enabling them to make informed decisions and contributing to a more responsible and informed digital environment.
